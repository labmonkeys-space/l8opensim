# SNMP reference

l8opensim answers SNMP v2c and v3 queries on UDP port 161 (override with
[`-snmp-port`](cli-flags.md#core-flags)) for every simulated device. The
stack is implemented in `go/simulator/snmp*.go` — see
[Architecture](architecture.md) for the component map.

## Protocol coverage

- **SNMP v2c** — `GET`, `GETNEXT`, `GETBULK` against the full per-device OID
  table. Community string is `public` by default.
- **SNMPv3** — enable with [`-snmpv3-engine-id`](cli-flags.md#snmpv3-flags).
  Auth protocols: `none`, `md5`, `sha1`. Privacy protocols: `none`, `des`,
  `aes128`. Auth and priv are implemented in `snmpv3.go` / `snmpv3_crypto.go`.

### SNMPv3 auth / priv matrix

| Auth  | Priv    | Security level  |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| none  | none    | `noAuthNoPriv`  |
| md5   | none    | `authNoPriv`    |
| sha1  | none    | `authNoPriv`    |
| md5   | des     | `authPriv`      |
| md5   | aes128  | `authPriv`      |
| sha1  | des     | `authPriv`      |
| sha1  | aes128  | `authPriv`      |

Per-device SNMPv3 credentials can be supplied when creating devices via the
REST API — see [Web API → Create devices](web-api.md#create-devices).

## OID lookup internals

OIDs are stored per-device in a `sync.Map` for lock-free O(1) reads under
concurrent load. Pre-computed next-OID mappings avoid scanning the table for
`GETNEXT` / `GETBULK` — each OID has a direct pointer to its lexicographic
successor. Request buffers come from a shared pool to reduce GC pressure on
SNMP-heavy workloads.

OIDs in resource files may be written with or without a leading dot — the
loader normalises them to the net-snmp convention (`.1.3.6.1…`) at startup.

## Dynamic HC interface traffic counters

`ifHCInOctets` (`.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6`) and `ifHCOutOctets`
(`.1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10`) are generated dynamically:

- Byte-rate oscillates between 60 % and 100 % of the interface's reported
  `ifHighSpeed` / `ifSpeed` on a 1-hour sine period.
- Each interface gets a random phase offset so interfaces within a device
  do not peak simultaneously.
- Counters are pre-seeded with ~24 h of traffic so they look realistic on
  the very first poll.
- Values are computed analytically on demand — no polling loop or
  per-interface goroutine — as monotonically increasing `Counter64`.
- Visible on both `GET` and `GETNEXT` / `GETBULK`.

```bash
# Walk ifXTable to see all HC counters (updates every poll)
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1

# Fetch HC in/out for interface 1 directly
snmpget -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 \
  1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6.1 \
  1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10.1

# Continuous rate monitoring (poll every 10 s)
watch -n 10 "snmpget -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 \
  1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.6.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.31.1.1.1.10.1"
```

## Dynamic CPU / memory / temperature metrics

CPU, memory, and temperature OIDs cycle through a 100-point pre-generated
sine-wave pattern per device, driven by `metrics_cycler.go`. Per-category
device profiles define the baseline ranges and spike amplitudes; see
`device_profiles.go`. GPU servers add per-GPU metric cycling on top of this —
see [GPU simulation](gpu/index.md).

## Interface-state scenarios

The [`-if-scenario`](cli-flags.md#interface-state-scenarios) flag controls
the `ifAdminStatus` / `ifOperStatus` values reported across every simulated
interface. Scenario 4 uses a deterministic `ifIndex % 100 < n` rule so
results are reproducible across restarts.

```bash
# Spot-check admin status (should all be "1" in scenarios 2/3/4)
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.7

# Verify oper status after scenario 3 (all-failure)
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.100.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8
```

## Entity MIB and vendor OIDs

Every network device ships with a properly aligned Entity MIB: chassis, line
cards, power supplies, fans, and temperature sensors — plus the
`entAliasMappingTable` linking physical ports to logical interfaces.
Vendor-specific OIDs (Cisco, Juniper, Arista, NVIDIA, etc.) are provided per
device type under `go/simulator/resources/<device>/`. See
[Resource files](resource-files.md) for the JSON schema and
[Device types](device-types.md) for the catalog.
